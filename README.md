Our Agendas : -
Breaking the whole website into the smallest divisions according to our strong zone.
Setting up the deadline for every individual.
Review the code when someone is unable to make the part prominently.
Regular commits in GitHub and 2 times stand up so that everyone is updated accordingly.
If some flaws are found in the original website, try to solve them as well.
Technologies used -
We used HTML-5 and CSS-3, Bootstrap jquery for front-end
Javascript for back-end
Localstorage is used for the data-storing purpose (as we are not introduced to the databases till now)

Website part,
This is our second project at Masai School using JavaScript, HTML, bootstrap, jquery, and CSS. We worked on Fitmeals”, an online fitness consulting website and online store as well.

This is our home page where we tried to build the same page as it is visible on the main website and also added some styles to look better, and linked the other pages to the home page.

Coming on to the header and footer part and also the navbar we have made as similar as the original webpage looks.


Coming to the Signup part we have the working signup page as it is exactly visible in the website.
